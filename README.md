# Youtube_Burner
 Provides a GUI to burn CDs from youtube links
 
This project cannot work because a library I thought would work actually doesn't do to youtube not appreciating this abuse of their API.
Originally tried pulling from a maven repository for the library but it was actually taken down. I then built the library manually from the projects github but it was no
longer functional due to youtube functional changes.

java -cp "lib/java-youtube-downloader-2.5.2.jar;lib/fastjson-1.2.76.jar" src/main/java/Main.java
